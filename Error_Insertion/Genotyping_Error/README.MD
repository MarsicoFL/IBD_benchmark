# Create VCF panel with genotyping error upon givn original VCF file and genotype errors.

The given error represents the total error rate in a diplotype, E.g. if 0.001 is given, then the error rate for a haplotye is 0.0005.

The program will create an random error location table by the highest error rate in the list, then takes less amount of error from the error table according to the error rate.

If given a list of error rate in **a single run**, the error locations in the lower error rate file(s) are always included by the higher error rate file(s).

Seeded based on time ticks, error locations in lower error file are **not garantied** included by higher error file, if you decide to run the generator multiple times.


## Input:
Original VCF file
A list of error rate

## Output:
VCF file(s) with given error rate.


Errors are generated by:
1. Randomly select a set of locations
2. Shift the value between 1 and 0.


## Usage:

Mofication:
Simply modify the ```error rate list``` and ```input path``` in ```program.cs```

Compiling and Execution:
Refer to ```/IBD_benchmark/IBD_Benchmark/README.MD```
