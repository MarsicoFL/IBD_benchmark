####Configuration file, tab delimiter.

####minBin minimum(first) genetic length for binning  
####maxBin maximum(last) genetic length for binning
####binLen length of each bin
####phasingErrorData	True or False, "True" will enable diplotype match instead of haplotype match, for phasing error data set.
####gMap_PositionCol_Index_ZeroBased	zero based column index of genetic map that has position info
####gMap_MapCol_Index_ZeroBased	zero based column index of genetic map that has genetic map info
####tool_Name	name of the IBD detection tool, Currently supported formats: FastSMC,hap-IBD,iLash,RaPID and TPBWT, add/modify the paser in Loader.cs for more formats.
####reported_Path	path of the IBD detection tool result

####gMap_Path	path of genetic map
####vcf_Path	path of vcf file that used as the input to IBD detection software 
####GT_Path	path of ground truth file. Note: formats could be different may need to modify parser in Loader module
####out_Path	path of accuracy and power result.
